# Simulation using BioSimSpace
---
In the simulation process I used the BioSimSpace framework to run 50 ns simulation process
Amber is the engine used in this simulation process

## How to run the Simulation process?
The Process is written as python script that can be run from the terminal and the files required for the simulation process eg prm7 and rst7 are passed as arguments

**As following**
***`python3 simulation.py path/to/first/file path/to/second/file`***

 *Note*
 In case you will run a long simulation process over ssh, it's preferred to run it through [screen](https://blog.knoldus.com/screen-command-in-linux/)
