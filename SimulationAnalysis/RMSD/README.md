# RMSD Bond Analysis
I used cpptraj, which is the main program in Amber for processing coordinate trajectories and data files, to carry on the RMSD analysis. 

In bioinformatics, the root-mean-square deviation of atomic positions, or simply root-mean-square deviation (RMSD), is the measure of the average distance between the atoms (usually the backbone atoms) of superimposed proteins.

The ***ligand_RMSD.traj and protein_RMSD.traj*** files used to calculate the RMSD for ligand and protein respectively.
