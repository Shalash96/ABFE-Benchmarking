# Simulation Process Analysis
---
After the the finish of the simulaton process, some analysis should be carried out such as
- RMSD Analysis
- H-bond Analysis

##RMSD
Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD) is used to describes the moleculeâ€™s overall discrepancy with respect to a reference conformation.

## H-Bond
### What is H bond?
A hydrogen bond (often informally abbreviated H-bond) is a partial intermolecular bonding interaction between a lone pair on an electron rich atom, particularly the second-row elements nitrogen (N), oxygen (O), or fluorine (F), and the antibonding molecular orbital of a bond between hydrogen (H) and a more electronegative atom or group.

### Role of H bonds in biology?
Hydrogen bonding plays an important role in determining the three-dimensional structures and the properties adopted by many synthetic and natural proteins.
 Amongst the usual components of free energy of interaction between molecules, particular hydrogen bonds may be crucial for the specificity of interaction.
